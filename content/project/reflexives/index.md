Reflexive pronouns such as herself and himself in English are subject to very rigid syntactic constraints on their use (e.g.  [the Binding Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_(linguistics))), constraints that vary in only limited ways cross-linguistically. We have investigated the degree to which these syntactic constraints guide the incremental comprehension and perception of reflexive pronouns, in English, German, Swedish, and Mandarin Chinese. Work in this project project has shown that comprehenders approximate a search through syntactic structure to identify an antecedent for a reflexive, but that syntactic structure is a violable constraint on antecedent identification. More recently, UMass alumnus [Shayne Sloggett‘s](link) research has shown that this search process also interacts with discourse-level constraints such as point of view, with comprehenders preferring to relate reflexive pronouns to entities whose point of view is assumed.
