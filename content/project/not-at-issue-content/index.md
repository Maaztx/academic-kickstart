In joint work with Lyn Frazier and Charles Clifton, Jr., we have investigated the processing of not-at-issue content, a broad class of linguistic expressions  linguistic expressions such as parentheticals, asides, or expressives (damn!) that supplement the main point or assertion that a speaker makes in a given utterance. This work has looked at how comprehenders chunk linguistic encodings in memory as a function of its (not-)at-issue discourse status, how speakers update the context using not-at-issue material, and how not at-issue material interacts with at-issue material for purposes of linguistic processing.
