Iâ€™m an associate professor in [Linguistics](ling) at the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](UMass). 

I am a psycholinguist, and I study how we encode and manage linguistic information in memory during the course of routine language understanding. In my work I use a range of computational and experimental tools, and I investigate data from a range of different languages. 

**My CV is [here](http://blogs.umass.edu/bwdillon/files/2017/09/BWDILLON_CV.pdf). You can find data, material, scripts, and write-ups of current projects on my [Open Science Framework page](asdf). Reach out at brian@linguist.umass.edu.**
