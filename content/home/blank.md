Across the different projects I am involved in, I seek to understand how linguistic information is cognitively represented, and how those representations support the (seemingly effortless) process of language comprehension. Some of the broad themes of this work include:

- How is syntactic and discourse structure represented in short-term and long-term memory?
- How do we access information coded in linguistic and extra-linguistic memory when necessary to support linguistic computation and language comprehension?
- How does the organization of linguistic information in memory impact decisions speakers make when producing or understanding language?
